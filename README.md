# Snake-game
A fully functional Snake game built using Python and Pygame, with a structured and modularized codebase. This project is a work in progress, as I continuously improve it by enhancing graphics, refining the architecture, and adding more in-depth documentation.

 Classic Snake gameplay with smooth controls
âœ… Structured and efficient code, easy to read and maintain
âœ… Constant updates â€“ improving graphics, adding modular architecture, and refining the overall game structure
âœ… Beginner-friendly â€“ well-commented code and clear explanations (more documentation coming soon!)

 Work in Progress
ðŸ”¹ Better graphics â€“ Improving visuals for a more polished experience
ðŸ”¹ Layered architecture â€“ Separating logic into structured modules
ðŸ”¹ More detailed documentation â€“ Adding explanations to make the code easier to understand

 How to Play
Run the game using Python:


python snake.py



Control the snake using the arrow keys
Eat the food and grow longer â€“ but donâ€™t hit the walls or yourself!
